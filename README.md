This code uses mpi library to count frequencies of words distributed in several files.
Manager-worker pattern is used for load balancing.This pattern is taken only for practicing, 
not meant for good performance.

Implemented with MPICH2-1.4.1p1 on windows platform with VS-2013.

Some ideas are from uwec cs252 hw3 http://www.cs.uwec.edu/~stevende/cs252/programs/mpiWordCount.pdf.
